# Jam

Jam is a frontend compiler implementation that compiles to the lekvar format.
Jam has a similar syntax to Python and Ruby with the aim to be readable and expressive.

The implementation is split between a lexer, that splits the input source into tokens, and a parser, which converts the tokens to lekvar.
