Comments
########

The only comments supported by Jam are single line comments. Due to modern
editors, multline toggling is only a keystroke away, thus eliminating the need
for block comments.

::

    # This a single line comment

    # This how multi line
    # Comments will work

Comments are only compiled when compiling in debug mode and otherwise ignored.
